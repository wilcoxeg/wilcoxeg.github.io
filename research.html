	To what extent are syntactic biases innate in the human language faculty? And how are they deployed during language processing and language learning? This research program seeks to use recent developments in language modeling to provide new empirical insight into these questions. By assessing how model architecture and training data affect the learning outcomes for contemporary neural network architectures, we can uncover the computational properties that guide language use in humans.

<p style="font-size:16pt;"><b> Experimental Semantics: Presupposition and Exhaustivity </b></p>
<div class = "row">
	The interpretation of linguistics utterances depends on both the logical form of the utterance (its semantics), as well as the context in which it was produced. In this work I use methods from experimental psycholinguistics as well as Bayesian modeling to develop and evaluate theories of presupposition, presupposition accommodation, and exhaustivity. Specifically, I ask how listeners cooperatively adjust their representations of common ground to accommodate assumptions that have been made by speakers during discourse. <br><br>

		Neural networks are everywhere, and have achieved state of the art performance on many NLP tasks. But to what extent do they serve as good models for human linguistic processing? This work seeks to benchmark neural network models by treating them like subjects in a psycholinguistic experiment. By deriving word-by-word predictions, and comparing these to classic studies of human word-by-word reading times, we can uncover the ways in which models' learned representations are driving behavior that is similar to (and different from) human behavior. <br><br>
