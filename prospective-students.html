<b> Prospective PhD Students: </b> <br> <br>

I will be recruiting students during the <b> Fall 2025 </b> PhD admissions cycle, through the Linguistics Department at Georgetown University. If you are interested in working with me as PhD student, please Submit your application through the Georgetown University Application portal. Make sure you apply to the “Computational Linguistics” concentration. <a href="https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/programs/phd-programs/"> <u> More information can be found at this link. </u> </a>

<br> <br>

<i> PhD Topics: </i> The best way to get a sense of the topics I am likely to supervise is to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5jzLBBwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"> <u> take a look at my recent publications. </u> </a> Below, is a partial list of my current foci.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Computational models of language processing (particularly language comprehension) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Data-efficient machine learning and its applications to language acquisition <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Information theory and its applications to linguistics, broadly <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  • Understanding the role of (multi)modality in language processing <br>

<br>


<i> Background: </i> My research is interdisciplinary, meaning I am interested in working with students from different intellectual backgrounds. If you have experience in either linguistics, experimental psychology, or computer science (especially Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning), then you are likely a good fit!
