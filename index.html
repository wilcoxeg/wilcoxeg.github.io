	I use computational modeling technology to understand how language processing happens in the human mind. Some of the big questions that my research addresses are: What computations does our mind perform when we listen to a sentence? What is universal about the way we process language, regardless of what individual language(s) we speak? And in the age of artificial intelligence, what is unique about the way that <i> people </i> process language?

	Currently, I am an ETH Postdoctoral Fellow at the ETH in Zürich, Switzerland. I am affiliated with <a href="https://rycolab.io/"> Rycolab </a> and the <a href="https://www.mrinmaya.io/"> Language Reasoning and Education Lab</a>, both in the Machine Learning Institute. Before moving to Zürich, I was a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. While there, I was affiliated with the <a href="http://cpl.mit.edu/"> Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory </a> at MIT and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home"> Meaning and Modality Laboratory </a> at Harvard. I did my undergraduate work at Stanford University, in the Symbolic Systems program, studying Computational Linguistics, as well as in the Slavic Literature department, where I wrote my <a href="http://satesperanto.org/IMG/pdf/Revolutionary_Linguistics.pdf"> honors thesis </a> on the history of the Esperanto movement in the USSR.
