I am a third year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at Harvard University. My research focuses on how state-of-the-art computational models can bear on theoretical issues of language learnability and how they can be used as models of language processing in humans. I also do work on Bayesian models of pragmatics, as well as issues surrounding linguistic diversity. I am affiliated with the <a href="http://cpl.mit.edu/"> Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory </a> at MIT and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home"> Meaning and Modality Laboratory </a> at Harvard. Before Grad School I worked as a freelance translator and computational linguist at <a href="https://transcendentendeavors.com/"> Transcendent Endeavors </a>. I did my undergraduate work at Stanford University, in the Symbolic Systems program and the Slavic Literature department, where I wrote my <a href="http://satesperanto.org/IMG/pdf/Revolutionary_Linguistics.pdf"> honors thesis </a> on the history of the Esperanto movement. <br>
