    I am a fifth year PhD student in the department of Linguistics at Harvard University. My research focuses on the interaction between structure (syntax), meaning (semantics) and context during language comprehension, using a variety of computational, experimental and formal techniques. I also use methods developed by linguists to analyze and interpret contemporary Natural Language Processing systems, and evaluate them as models of human langauge processing. The video at right is a talk I gave recently at the Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing Conference special session on Computational models of language processing.

	I am affiliated with the <a href="http://cpl.mit.edu/"> Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory </a> at MIT and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home"> Meaning and Modality Laboratory </a> at Harvard. Before Grad School I worked as a freelance translator and computational linguist at <a href="https://transcendentendeavors.com/"> Transcendent Endeavors </a>. I did my undergraduate work at Stanford University, in the Symbolic Systems program and the Slavic Literature department, where I wrote my <a href="http://satesperanto.org/IMG/pdf/Revolutionary_Linguistics.pdf"> honors thesis </a> on the history of the Esperanto movement.
