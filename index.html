	I am a computational psycholinguist. I use tools from computer science to build models of language processing and language acquisition. I am particularly interested in how people process language as they read, and how they make inferences about language structure during language learning.

	<br><br>

	<b> Update: </b> I have accepted a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the ETH in Zürich, Switzerland, and will start in September, 2022! At the ETH, I will be affiliated with <a href="https://rycolab.io/"> Rycolab </a> and the <a href="https://www.mrinmaya.io/"> Language Reasoning and Education Lab</a>, both in the Machine Learning Institute.

	<br> <br>

	Before moving to Zürich, I was a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. While there, I was affiliated with the <a href="http://cpl.mit.edu/"> Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory </a> at MIT and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home"> Meaning and Modality Laboratory </a> at Harvard. 

	<br><br>

	I did my undergraduate work at Stanford University, in the Symbolic Systems program, studying Computational Linguistics, as well as in the Slavic Literature department, where I wrote my <a href="http://satesperanto.org/IMG/pdf/Revolutionary_Linguistics.pdf"> honors thesis </a> on the history of the Esperanto movement in the USSR.

    How do children learn the structure of their language? And how do adults deploy structure during real-time communication? These types of questions have been central to linguists and cognitive scientists for many decades. My approach leverages recent advances in machine learning techniques to bring a new kind of empirical insight to these topics. I take algorithms designed to process natural language text and ask how well they serve as models of human linguistic cognition, focusing on grammatical competence as well as language processing behavior. In turn, I also use methods developed by linguists to analyze and interpret contemporary Natural Language Processing systems. The video at right is a talk	I gave at the Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing Conference, and gives a good overview of some of my research topics.
