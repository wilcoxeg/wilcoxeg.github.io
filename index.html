	I am an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_the_United_States"> Assistant </a> Professor of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/"> Computational Linguistics </a> at Georgetown University, in the <a href="https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/"> Linguistics Department</a>. I started my position here in September 2024.

We are an interdisciplinary group of researchers who use computational tools to understand how language is learned and processed in the human mind. </div>

	<b> <u> About my research:</u> </b> I use computational modeling technology to understand how people learn and process language. Some of the big questions that my research addresses are: What computations does our mind perform when we listen to a sentence? How can we learn langauge so rapidly when we're children? What is universal about the way we process language, regardless of what individual language(s) we speak? And in the age of artificial intelligence, what is unique about the way that <i> people </i> process language?

	<b> <u> Short Bio:</u> </b> Currently, I am an Assistant Professor of Computational Linguistics at Georgetown University. Previously, I was an ETH Postdoctoral Fellow at the ETH in Zürich, Switzerland, affiliated with <a href="https://rycolab.io/"> Rycolab </a> and the <a href="https://www.mrinmaya.io/"> Language Reasoning and Education Lab</a>, both in the Machine Learning Institute. Before moving to Zürich, I was a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. While there, I was affiliated with the <a href="http://cpl.mit.edu/"> Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory </a> at MIT and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home"> Meaning and Modality Laboratory </a> at Harvard. I did my undergraduate work at Stanford University, in the Symbolic Systems program, studying Computational Linguistics, as well as in the Slavic Literature department, where I wrote my <a href="http://satesperanto.org/IMG/pdf/Revolutionary_Linguistics.pdf"> honors thesis </a> on the history of the Esperanto movement in the USSR.
