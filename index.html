	<b> Update: </b> I have accepted a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland, and will start in September, 2022! At the ETH, I will be affiliated with <a href="https://rycolab.io/"> Rycolab </a> and <a href="https://www.mrinmaya.io/"> Mrynmaya's Lab</a>, both in the Machine Learning Institute.

	<br> <br>

	Before moving to Zurich, I was a PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Harvard University. While there, I was affiliated with the <a href="http://cpl.mit.edu/"> Computational Psycholinguistics Laboratory </a> at MIT and the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/meaningandmodality/home"> Meaning and Modality Laboratory </a> at Harvard. 

	<br><br>

	I did my undergraduate work at Stanford University, in the Symbolic Systems program, studying Computational Linguistics, as well as in the Slavic Literature department, where I wrote my <a href="http://satesperanto.org/IMG/pdf/Revolutionary_Linguistics.pdf"> honors thesis </a> on the history of the Esperanto movement in the USSR.

    My research focuses on the interaction between structure (syntax), meaning (semantics) and context during language comprehension, using a variety of computational, experimental and formal techniques. I also use methods developed by linguists to analyze and interpret contemporary Natural Language Processing systems, and evaluate them as models of human langauge processing. The video at right is a talk I gave recently at the Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing Conference special session on Computational models of language processing and gives a good overview of some of my research topics.
