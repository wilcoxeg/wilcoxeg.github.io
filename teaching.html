I love teaching, and find that it is also an incredible way for me to learn. I am a big believer in visual diagrams, especially when they are drawn out larger than life on the blackboard. I try to incorporate as much tech as I can into my teaching, for example the image below is a self-paced-reading study my students and I conducted in class. These results show the classic slowdown in processing time for a Main Verb / Reduced Relative clause (MV/RR) gardenpath sentence. It was really valuable to demonstrate how linguistic experiments and data analysis were carried out in real time! <br>
