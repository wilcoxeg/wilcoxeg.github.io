I love teaching, and find that it is also an incredible way for me to learn. I am a big believer in visual diagrams, especially when they are drawn out larger than life on the blackboard. I try to incorporate as much tech as I can into my teaching, for example the image below is a self-paced-reading study me and my students did in class. It shows the classic garden-path effect for a Main Verb / Reduced Relative clause (MV/RR) gardenpath sentence. It was really valuable to demonstrate how linguistic experiments and data analysis were carried out in real time! <br>
